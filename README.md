Overview:
My local volleyball league has increasing membership and constraints for
scheduling that I have not seen available in other tools. In addition, I am
interested in discrete optimization and decided to have some fun with the
problem. 

This system is currently set up to generate this specific season's schedule by running the maker.py command. The next step is generalizing the interface and building it into a Django site.
