Overview:
My local volleyball league has increasing membership and constraints for
scheduling that I have not seen available in other tools. In addition, I am
interested in discrete optimization and decided to have some fun with the
problem. Currently, this repository is the skeleton of a Django project, but
the operational section is the scheduler. This tool generate a template of
days and times for different divisions to complete, and then solve for the
best schedule based on various parameters.
