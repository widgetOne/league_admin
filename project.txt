Near-term Goals:

Deliverables:
Mid-Season Re-rate report
    link player processing with the schedule to tell S&D when people are free to do mid-season rerates
Board Committee debug view
    Sometimes having board members free or present for certain events is important. I should add a
    debug report to the schedule audit report saying which board members are playing when in a week
Link to Google Sheets
    It should not be hard to use the google sheet API to directly access
    and pull down the datafiles for players, teams and schedule (auth protection will be critical, of course)
